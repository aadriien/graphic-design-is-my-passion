# 🌈💖 Graphic Design is My Passion!

## Description

Channel your inner artist with this gloriously chaotic **Chrome browswer extension**! Inspired by the high-energy excitement of messy frontend from the early 2000s, this extension guarantees a healthy dose of laughter and whimsy with each webpage you visit. 

This toy project was made in the span of a couple hours during **Terrible Ideas Day at [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com)**. I organized the event in the hopes of encouraging the community to release the pressure of perfection, dive into the joys of playful programming, and work at the edge of their abilities—**building purely for fun**. So many fantastic creations came out of Terrible Ideas Day (including a few other browser extensions!), and I sincerely hope that this mindset of silly experimentation continues to inspire folks at RC and beyond!
